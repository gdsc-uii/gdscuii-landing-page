# MenstruAction: Combating Period Poverty in Indonesia
Period poverty is a harsh reality for millions of women and girls around the world. In Indonesia, the lack of access to sanitary products, education, and adequate healthcare leaves many girls unable to manage their menstruation with dignity and comfort. To address this issue, we introduce MenstruAction!

## What is MenstruAction?
MenstruAction is a platform created by the Oke Google team that aims to reduce menstrual poverty in Indonesia by providing access to education and menstrual products.

## Aligns with SDG No. 5: Gender Equality and Womenâ€™s Empowerment
Target 5.6 aims to enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women. MesntruActio utilizes technology to disseminate information on menstrual hygiene and facilitate donations, which can empower women by providing them with the knowledge and resources they need to manage their menstrual hygiene and improve their overall health.

## Donation
Through our donation feature, MenstruAction allows users to make a contribution to help provide sanitary products to girls in need. With just a few clicks, anyone can support this cause and make a real difference in the lives of young women across Indonesia. We work with local communities to ensure that these products are distributed to those who need them most. Every donation counts, and it all adds up to help create a more sustainable future for menstrual health.

## Education
In addition to donations, MenstruAction also offers educational content to help women and girls better understand their menstrual health. Our platform provides information on topics such as menstrual cycle, hygiene, and period-related disorders. By empowering women with knowledge and awareness, we hope to break the stigma surrounding menstruation and promote positive attitudes towards women's health.

## How Does MenstruAction Work?
MenstruAction is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to everyone. Our platform is available both on desktop and mobile devices, making it easy to donate or access educational content anytime, anywhere. You can access MenstruAction through this link <a href="https://menstruaction.gdscuii.id/" class="text-green-700">menstruaction.gdscuii.id</a>.

On the platform, users can make monetary donations that will go towards purchasing menstrual products. Users can go through the donation page and set the amount of period necessities they want to donate.
